# GAN in TensorFlow
TensorFlow implementation of Generative Adversarial Nets which can generate something by computer.If you don't know about Tensorflow see [https://github.com/tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow) and find more details about it. I use TensorFlow in Python implement the GAN as it described in paper and their open source code implemented in pylearn. The orginal paper of these code can find in [Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661). Futhermore, you can find GAN implemented in Pylearn in [here](https://github.com/goodfeli/adversarial).

## Prerequisites
- Python 2.7 or Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 1.0.0+
- Numpy
- matplotlib
- Scipy(optional, if you want to run code in MNIST set)
- PIL(optional, if you want to run code in MNIST set)

## Usage
If you want to run simple sample learn to draw normal distrubition, just run with:  
$ python main.py
